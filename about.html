					<h1>Frozen Yogurt</h1>
					<p>Frozen yogurt is a frozen dessert made with yogurt and sometimes other dairy and non-dairy products. Usually more tart than ice cream, as well as lower in fat, it is different from ice milk and conventional soft serve. </p>
				</div>

					<h1>The Basics: Serving Size</h1>

					Self-serve yogurt containers can usually hold between 16 and 24 ounces of the cold treat. Yogurt averages about 100 calories per 1/2 cup. Do the math. Fill your cup to the brim, and you might mistakenly be eating more than 500 calories in yogurt alone. Add sweet toppings like those brownie bites and gummy worms and you’re well on your way to sabotaging your best intentions. Your cup of yogurt could have more calories than a Big Mac.</p>
					

					<h1>FroYo vs. Ice Cream</h1>
					<p>Ounce for ounce, frozen yogurt has fewer calories and is lower in saturated fat than regular ice cream. But, if you choose low-fat ice cream, the calories and saturated fat are about the same. For example, 1/2 cup of Breyer’s “1/2 the Fat” vanilla ice cream has 100 calories and 2 grams of saturated fat. The same amount of frozen yogurt, original flavor from Pinkberry, has 100 calories and 0 grams of saturated fat. Depending on the flavor, some frozen yogurts might also have more added sugar than ice cream. Many ice cream and yogurt companies now offer their nutritional information online. This is a valuable resource that I recommend checking out.</p>
					<h1>Tips for a Healthier FroYo:</h1>
					
					<p>
						Don’t fill your cup. You might feel silly for only covering the bottom of the container with one layer of frozen yogurt, but by keeping your portion size to a 1/2 cup, you’ll stay within a healthy calorie range. 
					</p>
						
					<p>
						Load up on fruit. Many frozen yogurt places have fresh fruit to add to your cup. This is an excellent way to add some sweetness without the extra calories.
					</p>
					<p>
						If you want a sweet treat to add to your yogurt, choose one. For example, I love the combination of original frozen yogurt, strawberries, mango, and brownie bites. Remember that some toppings have up to 50 calories per serving which can add up quickly.
