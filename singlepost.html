					<h1>NEW CHILLS FOR SUMMER</h1>
					<h3>FROZEN BREAKFAST SMOOTHIE </h3>
					<p>Recipe:
						Ingredients:
						<p>1. 4 oz. strawberries</p>
						<p>2. 4 oz. raspberries</p>
						<p>3. 4 oz. blueberries</p>
						<p>4. 1 quart plain or vanilla Greek yogurt</p>
						<p>5. 1/4 cup milk</p>
						<p>6. 1/4 honey (optional)</p>
						<p>7. 1 1/2 cups granola (recipe follows)</p>
					<p>Directions:
						In a medium size pan over medium hight heat, combine and cook strawberries and raspberries until it simmers rapidly. Cook for 10-12 minutes, stirring often, until mixture thickens. Remove from heat and let cool to room temperature. Repeat with blueberries. (If berries need some sweetening add 4-5 tablespoons sugar to achieve preferred sweetness.)

						In a large bowl, combine and mix together yogurt, milk and honey. Mixture should be thick, but pourable.</p>

					<p>To assemble:

						Pour a tablespoon or two of yogurt in to each mold. Add a tablespoon of granola and then a tablespoon or two of fruit jam. Continue layering until molds are filled. Tap mold against counter to release any air bubbles. Insert popsicle stick and freeze for at least 6 hours (time will vary according to freezer setting and how full it is). To remove smoothie pops from mold, run it under hot water. Unmold and enjoy! Separate each frozen pop with parchment paper and transfer to freezer. Popsicles will keep for unto three weeks.</p>

					<h1>Berries On The Grove </h1>
					<h3>Chocolate Cherry Frozen Yogurt</h3>
					<p>Ingredients:
					1. 4 cups fat free plain, Greek yogurt
					2. 3/4 cup sugar
                    3. 1 tablespoon pure vanilla extract
					4. 1/3 cup cocoa powder, sifted
					5. 1 1/2 cups fresh cherries, pitted and  halved or quartered if very large</p>
					<p>
					Instructions
						Line a large, mesh strainer with a double layer of paper towels, and place it over a large, deep mixing bowl. Add the yogurt, cover with plastic wrap, and let it strain the refrigerator for at least 6 hours, and ideally overnight. (Straining the liquid from the yogurt will help prevent your frozen yogurt from being too icy.)

						Add the sugar, vanilla and 1/4 cup of water to a small saucepan and place it over medium-low heat. Whisk it and and warm it just long enough to dissolve the sugar. Set aside to cool.

						Remove the yogurt from the refrigerator. Discard the drained off liquid, and add the yogurt to a large mixing bowl. Whisk in the cocoa powder, followed by the dissolved sugar. If the sugar is still on the warm side, whisk very quickly. Fold in the cherries, cover the bowl tightly with plastic wrap, and refrigerate for at least a couple of hours.

						Transfer to an ice cream maker, and freeze according to the machine instructions.

						For soft serve, serve immediately. Otherwise, place the frozen yogurt in an airtight container in the freezer overnight.</p>
